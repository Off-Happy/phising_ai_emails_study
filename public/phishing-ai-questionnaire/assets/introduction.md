## Welcome
Thank you for participating in this study on how people perceive potential phishing emails.

## Purpose
This questionnaire is part of a study examining how accurately users can identify content generated by large language models (LLMs) in the context of phishing emails.

## What you will do
1. Answer a short set of questions about general background and attitudes toward privacy and security.
2. Review 6 emails (each shown once).
3. For each email, indicate whether you believe it is phishing and whether it appears LLM‑generated.
4. Select the aspects of the email that most influenced your decisions.
5. Optionally, provide feedback at the end.

## Time and devices
Estimated time: 9–10 minutes. For the best experience, use a modern desktop or laptop. If you use a phone, please rotate it to landscape mode.

## Your data
