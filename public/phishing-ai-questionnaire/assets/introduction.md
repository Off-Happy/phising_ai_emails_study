## Welcome
Thank you for taking part in our phishing email perception study.

## Purpose
We are investigating how wording and possible AI generation influence how legitimate an email appears. Your answers help improve phishing detection and user safety.

## What You Will Do
1. Review a series of emails (each shown once).
2. For each email, inspect the content and (optionally) its headers.
3. Answer a few short questions about phishing suspicion and possible AI involvement.

## Time & Devices
Estimated time: 5–7 minutes. Please use a modern desktop or laptop browser for best experience.

## Your Data
Participation is voluntary. Responses are confidential and anonymized. Data is used only for research at the University of Groningen.

## Tips
- Read carefully before judging legitimacy.
- Hover or open header details if unsure.
- Trust your first impression, then re-check links (do not actually navigate).
